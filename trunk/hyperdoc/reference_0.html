</p>
<p>GBBopen is a modern, high-performance, open source blackboard-system
development environment that is based on the concepts that were explored and
refined in the <a target="_top" href="http://dancorkill.home.comcast.net/pubs/aaai87.pdf">UMass Generic Blackboard
system</a> and the
commercial GBB product.  GBBopen is not, however, a clone or updated version
of either system.  The GBBopen Project is applying the knowledge and
experience gained with these earlier tools to create a new generation of
blackboard-system capabilities and make them freely available to a wide
audience.
</p>
<p>GBBopen is structured for high-performance and scalability while
maintaining flexibility and adaptability to changes in representation,
<a href="ref-glossary.html#gl:KS">knowledge-source</a> (KS) components, and control strategies.
Multi-dimensional abstraction of blackboard components
(&#8220;<a href="ref-glossary.html#id144">space&nbsp;instance</a>s&#8221;), blackboard objects
(&#8220;<a href="ref-glossary.html#id160">unit&nbsp;instance</a>s&#8221;), and proximity-based retrieval patterns
is used to provide a semantically meaningful separation of
blackboard-repository storage mechanisms from <a href="ref-glossary.html#gl:KS">KS</a> and control code.
This separation allows storage and search strategies and optimizations
to change dynamically as well as to be adapted to a broad range of
application areas.  GBBopen also provides highly efficient and
extensible event primitives that form the foundation for fast, yet
effective, opportunistic control reasoning.
</p>
<p>At the implementation level, GBBopen is designed as a smooth extension
of <a target="_top" href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Front/index.htm">Common
Lisp</a>,
providing all the advantages of a rich, dynamic, reflective, and
extensible programming language to the blackboard-system architects
and component writers.  These capabilities are crucial in building
complex blackboard-based applications where object representations,
knowledge sources (<a href="ref-glossary.html#gl:KS">KS</a>s), and control mechanisms will change
during development and over the operational lifetime of the blackboard
application. GBBopen is tightly integrated with CLOS (the Common Lisp
Object System) and provides additional blackboard-specific object
mechanisms via the <a target="_top" href="http://www.lisp.org/mop/index.html">Metaobject
Protocol</a>.
</p>
<p>The open-source licensing of GBBopen provides a number of important benefits:
</p>
<ul><li>A modular, open-source reference implementation of
blackboard-system infrastructure that serves as a basis for research
and development activities.
</li><li>The availability of source code and the right to modify it
enables unlimited improvement and enhancement of the software. It
also makes it possible to port the code to new hardware and
software, to adapt it to changing conditions, and to reach a
detailed understanding of how GBBopen works. Source code
availability also makes it much easier to isolate and fix bugs.
</li><li>The right to redistribute improvements and extensions to the
GBBopen source code.
</li><li>The right to use the software.
</li><li>There is no single entity on which the future of the GBBopen
software depends. This is particularly important given the highly
specialized nature of blackboard-system software and the lack of
multiple implementations.
</li><li>GBBopen supports alternative and additional GBBopen modules for
use in research and experimentation.
