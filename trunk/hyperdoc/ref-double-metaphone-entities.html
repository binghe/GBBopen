<h2>Double Metaphone</h2>
<p>The <nobr><code>:double-metaphone</code></nobr> <a href="ref-glossary.html#gl:module">module</a> provides Double Metaphone
phonetic-code generation.
</p>
<p>The Metaphone algorithm, published by Lawrence Philips in 1990, improved early
phonetic approaches, such as Soundex, by attempting to correctly code cases
where &#8220;gh&#8221; is pronounced as &#8220;f&#8221; as in &#8220;laugh&#8221; and when it is silent, as
in &#8220;dough,&#8221; or where &#8220;t,&#8221; &#8220;c,&#8221; and &#8220;s&#8221; are pronounced as &#8220;sh&#8221; (or
&#8220;ch,&#8221; which is treated as a sound that is similar enough to &#8220;sh&#8221; to be
mapped to the same encoding value) as in &#8220;ratio,&#8221; &#8220;ciao,&#8221; and &#8220;erosion.&#8221;
Although Metaphone was an improvement, it failed to encode many common words
accurately, including the silent &#8220;l&#8221; in &#8220;lincoln,&#8221; and the case of
&#8220;school&#8221; where &#8220;ch&#8221; is pronounced as &#8220;k.&#8221; Also, by using the Soundex
style of encoding an initial vowel as it appears, Metaphone results in
different encodings for &#8220;Otto&#8221; and &#8220;auto,&#8221; which sound similar enough to
match.
</p>
<p>Double Metaphone was published by Lawrence Philips in 2000 to improve accuracy
further than was achieved by Metaphone. It maps all initial vowels to &#8220;A,&#8221;
matching &#8220;Otto&#8221; to &#8220;auto.&#8221; It attempts to correctly encode a number of
common words and names commonly found in the United States that are of
non-english origin and are usually pronounced correctly according to their
non-english spellings, by Americans, such as &#8220;Jose&#8221; or &#8220;pizza.&#8221;  It also
attempts to account for cases where more than one pronunciation may be common
in the United States, such as the Spanish name &#8220;Cabrillo&#8221; which might be
plausibly pronounced as &#8220;cabreeyo&#8221; or &#8220;cabrillo.&#8221; Double Metaphone
addresses exceptions in regular English pronunciation, such as the many cases
of silent consonants, such as the silent &#8220;l&#8221; in &#8220;lincoln&#8221; or the silent
&#8220;s&#8221; in &#8220;island,&#8221; as well as the pronunciation of &#8220;s&#8221; as &#8220;sh&#8221; in
&#8220;sugar,&#8221; or an anomaly like &#8220;caesar,&#8221; an unusual case of a &#8220;c&#8221; followed
by an &#8220;a&#8221; where the &#8220;c&#8221; is pronounced as &#8220;s.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Even with this more detailed treatment, Double Metaphone still misses a number
of common exceptions, such as the silent &#8220;p&#8221; in &#8220;receipt,&#8221; many cases
where &#8220;ch&#8221; is pronounced as &#8220;k&#8221; instead of &#8220;ch&#8221; as in &#8220;monarch,&#8221; many
cases where Americans pronounce words of non-English origin according to their
non-English pronunciations, such as &#8220;chutzpah,&#8221; and exceptions such as
&#8220;colonel,&#8221; pronounced &#8220;kernal,&#8221; and &#8220;tucson,&#8221; pronounced &#8220;tooson.&#8221;
</p>
<p>In addition to providing strict adherence to the Double Metaphone algorithm,
this Common Lisp implementation also supports an extended-encoding option that
activates additional encoding rules that separate the sounds used for &#8220;B&#8221;
and &#8220;P,&#8221; for &#8220;D&#8221; and &#8220;T,&#8221; for &#8220;F&#8221; and &#8220;V,&#8221; and for &#8220;S&#8221; and &#8220;Z.&#8221;
The extended-encoding option often produces phonetic-code results that are
more natural and intuitive.
