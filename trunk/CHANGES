Important changes coming in GBBopen 0.9.8:

  * New DELETE-BLACKBOARD-REPOSITORY function replaces typical uses of
    RESET-GBBOPEN
    - RESET-GBBOPEN unconditionally deletes/resets all instances, event 
      functions, and event printing 
    - DELETE-BLACKBOARD-REPOSITORY includes new :ALL-CLASSES keyword 
      (overrides :RETAIN class option);

  * New :RETAIN class option in DEFINE-UNIT-CLASS (and DEFINE-SPACE-CLASS,
    DEFINE-KS-CLASS, and DEFINE-KSA-CLASS), controls default
    DELETE-BLACKBOARD-REPOSITORY behavior on instances of that class:
      nil  = don't retain 
      true = retain (a value of :PROPAGATE indicates propagation of
                     :PROPAGATE retention value (as default) to subclasses)

  * Queue objects (headers, elements) are now unit instances, new Agenda
    Shell unit classes KSA-QUEUE and ORDERED-KSA-QUEUE

  * New :name argument for START-CONTROL-SHELL and RESUME-CONTROL-SHELL


Important changes in GBBopen 0.9.7:

  * Renamed functions:
       ALLOWED-UNIT-CLASSES      -> ALLOWED-UNIT-CLASSES-OF
       SPACE-INSTANCE-CHILDREN   -> CHILDREN-OF
       SPACE-INSTANCE-DIMENSIONS -> DIMENSIONS-OF
       SPACE-INSTANCE-PARENT     -> PARENT-OF
       UNIT-CLASS-DIMENSIONS     -> DIMENSIONS-OF

  * Save & load blackboard repository support; PRINT-OBJECT-FOR-SAVING/SENDING
    protocol

  * Version 1.2 of the Mini-Module System
    - Support for module-relative directory specifications; implicit module
      rooting

  * Added LIST-LENGTH>1, LIST-LENGTH>, SHRINK-VECTOR, and TRIMMED-SUBSTRING to
    GBBopen-tools
 
  * Version 2.2 of the Portable Threads Interface
    - Periodic functions

  * Version 2.1 of the Portable Threads Interface
    - Scheduled functions, new THREAD-ALIVE-P and ENCODE-TIME-OF-DAY functions

  * Version 2.0 of the Portable Threads Interface
    - Recursive and nonrecursive locks, with stronger enforcement of usage
      violations (to reduce the potential for different behavior on different
      CL implementations).
    - Use of condition variables for thread waiting/notification
    - Improved hibernation behavior
    - New WITH-TIMEOUT function

    The names of many Portable Threads functions were changed (for
    consistency with new capabilities and to make the portable-threads
    interface names more "thread-centric" rather than "process-centric"):
       ALL-PROCESSES             -> ALL-THREADS
       AWAKEN-PROCESS            -> AWAKEN-THREAD
       CURRENT-PROCESS           -> CURRENT-THREAD
       HIBERNATE-PROCESS         -> HIBERNATE-THREAD
       KILL-PROCESS              -> KILL-THREAD
       MAKE-PROCESS-LOCK         -> MAKE-RECURSIVE-LOCK
       PROCESS-NAME              -> THREAD-NAME
       PROCESSP                  -> THREADP
       PROCESS-WAIT              -> THREAD-WAIT
       PROCESS-WAIT-WITH-TIMEOUT -> THREAD-WAIT-WITH-TIMEOUT
       PROCESS-WHOSTATE          -> THREAD-WHOSTATE
       PROCESS-YIELD             -> THREAD-YIELD
       RUN-IN-PROCESS            -> RUN-IN-THREAD
       SPAWN-PROCESS             -> SPAWN-THREAD
       SYMBOL-VALUE-IN-PROCESS   -> SYMBOL-VALUE-IN-THREAD
       WITH-PROCESS-LOCK         -> WITH-LOCK-HELD
       <new>                        CONDITION-VARIABLE (object)
       <new>                        CONDITION-VARIABLE-BROADCAST
       <new>                        CONDITION-VARIABLE-SIGNAL
       <new>                        CONDITION-VARIABLE-WAIT
       <new>                        CONDITION-VARIABLE-WAIT-WITH-TIMEOUT
       <new>                        MAKE-CONDITION-VARIABLE
       <new>                        MAKE-LOCK
       <new>                        THREAD-HOLDS-LOCK-P
       CLOSE-GATE                   <removed>
       GATE-OPEN-P                  <removed>
       MAKE-GATE                    <removed>
       OPEN-GATE                    <removed>
       PROCESS-WAIT                 <removed>
       PROCESS-WAIT-WITH-TIMEOUT    <removed>


Important changes in GBBopen 0.9.6:

  * Rewrite of the uniform-buckets storage machinery and how it interacts 
    with WITH-CHANGING-DIMENSION-VALUES. 


Important changes in GBBopen 0.9.5:

  * The default accessors generated by DEFINE-CLASS, DEFINE-EVENT-CLASS, 
    DEFINE-UNIT-CLASS, and DEFINE-SPACE-CLASS are now <slot-name>-OF (:suffix
    format) rather than <class-name>.<slot-name> (:prefix format).

  * A new macro WITH-GENERATE-ACCESSORS-FORMAT is provided to facilitate
    historical (:prefix format) or other non-standard accessor-name generation
    in a block of DEFINE-CLASS, DEFINE-EVENT-CLASS, DEFINE-UNIT-CLASS, and
    DEFINE-SPACE-CLASS definitions.

  * The accessor INSTANCE-NAME-OF replaced INSTANCE-NAME 

  * The function SPACE-INSTANCES-OF replaced INSTANCE-SPACE-INSTANCES

  * The generic function SOLE-TRIGGER-INSTANCE-OF replaced
    SOLE-TRIGGER-INSTANCE

  * The generic function SOLE-TRIGGER-EVENT-OF replaced SOLE-TRIGGER-EVENT

  * The accessor KS-ENABLED-P replaced KS.ENABLED

  * The PENDING-ACTIVATION-OF link-slot in the KSA unit-class replaced
    PENDING-ACTIVATION

  * The accessor ACTIVATION-CYCLE-OF replaced KSA.ACTIVATION-CYCLE

  * The accessor EXECUTION-CYCLE-OF replaced KSA.EXECUTION-CYCLE

  * The accessor KS-OF replaced KSA.KS

  * The accessor OBVIATION-CYCLE-OF replaced KSA.OBVIATION-CYCLE

  * The accessor RATING-OF replaced KSA.RATING

  * The accessor TRIGGER-EVENTS-OF replaced KSA.TRIGGER-EVENTS

  * The slot accessors of all standard GBBopen system and control-shell events
    were changed to <slot-name>-OF (:suffix) format.
