Important changes in GBBopen 0.9.7:

  * Renamed functions:
       allowed-unit-classes      -> allowed-unit-classes-of
       space-instance-children   -> children-of
       space-instance-dimensions -> dimensions-of
       space-instance-parent     -> parent-of
       unit-class-dimensions     -> dimensions-of

  * Save & load blackboard repository support; print-object-for-saving/sending
    protocol

  * Version 1.2 of the Mini-Module System
    - Support for module-relative directory specifications; implicit module
      rooting

  * Added list-length>1, list-length>, shrink-vector, and trimmed-substring to
    GBBopen-tools
 
  * Version 2.2 of the Portable Threads Interface
    - Periodic functions

  * Version 2.1 of the Portable Threads Interface
    - Scheduled functions, thread-alive-p, encode-time-of-day

  * Version 2.0 of the Portable Threads Interface
    - Recursive and nonrecursive locks, with stronger enforcement of usage
      violations (to reduce the potential for different behavior on different
      CL implementations).
    - Use of condition variables for thread waiting/notification
    - Improved hibernation behavior
    - With-timeout added

    The names of many Portable Threads functions were changed (for
    consistency with new capabilities and to make the portable-threads
    interface names more "thread-centric" rather than "process-centric"):
       all-processes              all-threads
       awaken-process             awaken-thread
       current-process            current-thread
       hibernate-process          hibernate-thread
       kill-process               kill-thread
       make-process-lock          make-recursive-lock
       process-name               thread-name
       processp                   threadp
       process-wait               thread-wait
       process-wait-with-timeout  thread-wait-with-timeout
       process-whostate           thread-whostate
       process-yield              thread-yield
       run-in-process             run-in-thread
       spawn-process              spawn-thread
       symbol-value-in-process    symbol-value-in-thread
       with-process-lock          with-lock-held
       <new>                      condition-variable (object)
       <new>                      condition-variable-broadcast
       <new>                      condition-variable-signal
       <new>                      condition-variable-wait
       <new>                      condition-variable-wait-with-timeout
       <new>                      make-condition-variable
       <new>                      make-lock
       <new>                      thread-holds-lock-p
       close-gate                 <removed>
       gate-open-p                <removed>
       make-gate                  <removed>
       open-gate                  <removed>
       process-wait               <removed>
       process-wait-with-timeout  <removed>


Important changes in GBBopen 0.9.6:

  * Rewrite of the uniform-buckets storage machinery and how it interacts 
    with with-changing-dimension-values. 


Important changes in GBBopen 0.9.5:

  * The default accessors generated by DEFINE-CLASS, DEFINE-EVENT-CLASS, 
    DEFINE-UNIT-CLASS, and DEFINE-SPACE-CLASS are now <slot-name>-OF (:suffix
    format) rather than <class-name>.<slot-name> (:prefix format).

  * A new macro WITH-GENERATE-ACCESSORS-FORMAT is provided to facilitate
    historical (:prefix format) or other non-standard accessor-name generation
    in a block of DEFINE-CLASS, DEFINE-EVENT-CLASS, DEFINE-UNIT-CLASS, and
    DEFINE-SPACE-CLASS definitions.

  * The accessor INSTANCE-NAME-OF replaced INSTANCE-NAME 

  * The function SPACE-INSTANCES-OF replaced INSTANCE-SPACE-INSTANCES

  * The generic function SOLE-TRIGGER-INSTANCE-OF replaced
    SOLE-TRIGGER-INSTANCE

  * The generic function SOLE-TRIGGER-EVENT-OF replaced SOLE-TRIGGER-EVENT

  * The accessor KS-ENABLED-P replaced KS.ENABLED

  * The PENDING-ACTIVATION-OF link-slot in the KSA unit-class replaced
    PENDING-ACTIVATION

  * The accessor ACTIVATION-CYCLE-OF replaced KSA.ACTIVATION-CYCLE

  * The accessor EXECUTION-CYCLE-OF replaced KSA.EXECUTION-CYCLE

  * The accessor KS-OF replaced KSA.KS

  * The accessor OBVIATION-CYCLE-OF replaced KSA.OBVIATION-CYCLE

  * The accessor RATING-OF replaced KSA.RATING

  * The accessor TRIGGER-EVENTS-OF replaced KSA.TRIGGER-EVENTS

  * The slot accessors of all standard GBBopen system and control-shell events
    were changed to <slot-name>-OF (:suffix) format.
