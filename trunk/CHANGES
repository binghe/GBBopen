Important changes since GBBopen 0.9.6:

  * Version 2.0 of the Portable Threads Interface
    - Recursive and nonrecursive locks, with stronger enforcement of usage
      violations (to reduce the potential for different behavior on different
      CL implementations).
    - Emphasis on condition variables for thread waiting/notification
    - Improved hibernation behavior
    - With-timeout added
    Allegro-style gates and process-wait are depreciated and will be removed
    soon. (See the GBBopen Reference Manual for details.)

    The names of many Portable Threads functions have been changed (for
    consistency with new capabilities and to make the portable-threads
    interface names more "thread-centric" rather than "process-centric"):
       all-processes              all-threads
       awaken-process             awaken-thread
       current-process            current-thread
       hibernate-process          hibernate-thread
       kill-process               kill-thread
       make-process-lock          make-recursive-lock
       process-name               thread-name
       processp                   threadp
       process-wait               thread-wait
       process-wait-with-timeout  thread-wait-with-timeout
       process-whostate           thread-whostate
       process-yield              thread-yield
       run-in-process             run-in-thread
       spawn-process              spawn-thread
       symbol-value-in-process    symbol-value-in-thread
       with-process-lock          with-lock-held
       <new>                      condition-variable (object)
       <new>                      condition-variable-broadcast
       <new>                      condition-variable-signal
       <new>                      condition-variable-wait
       <new>                      condition-variable-wait-with-timeout
       <new>                      make-condition-variable
       <new>                      make-lock
       <new>                      thread-holds-lock-p
       close-gate                 <deprecated>
       gate-open-p                <deprecated>
       make-gate                  <deprecated>
       open-gate                  <deprecated>
       process-wait               <deprecated>
       process-wait-with-timeout  <deprecated>


Important changes in GBBopen 0.9.6:

  * Rewrite of the uniform-buckets storage machinery and how it interacts 
    with with-changing-dimension-values. 

  * Removal of all deprecated accessors & functions that were still supported
    in GBBopen 0.9.5 (including INSTANCE-NAME, SOLE-TRIGGER-INSTANCE,  and 
    INSTANCE-SPACE-INSTANCES).


Important changes in GBBopen 0.9.5:

  * The default accessors generated by DEFINE-CLASS, DEFINE-EVENT-CLASS, 
    DEFINE-UNIT-CLASS, and DEFINE-SPACE-CLASS is now <slot-name>-OF (:suffix
    format) rather than <class-name>.<slot-name> (:prefix format).

  * A new macro WITH-GENERATE-ACCESSORS-FORMAT is provided to facilitate
    historical (:prefix format) or other non-standard accessor-name generation
    in a block of DEFINE-CLASS, DEFINE-EVENT-CLASS, DEFINE-UNIT-CLASS, and
    DEFINE-SPACE-CLASS definitions.

  * The accessor INSTANCE-NAME-OF replaces INSTANCE-NAME (an INSTANCE-NAME
    accessor remains available in 0.9.5, but INSTANCE-NAME is deprecated and
    will be removed in GBBopen 0.9.6).

  * The function SPACE-INSTANCES-OF replaces INSTANCE-SPACE-INSTANCES (an
    INSTANCE-SPACE-INSTANCES function remains available in 0.9.5, but it is
    deprecated and will be removed in GBBopen 0.9.6).

  * The generic function SOLE-TRIGGER-INSTANCE-OF replaces
    SOLE-TRIGGER-INSTANCE (the generic function SOLE-TRIGGER-INSTANCE remains
    available in 0.9.5, but it is deprecated and will be removed in GBBopen
    0.9.6).

  * The generic function SOLE-TRIGGER-EVENT-OF replaces
    SOLE-TRIGGER-EVENT (the generic function SOLE-TRIGGER-EVENT remains
    available in 0.9.5, but it is deprecated and will be removed in GBBopen
    0.9.6).

  * The accessor KS-ENABLED-P replaces KS.ENABLED (a KS.ENABLED accessor
    remains available in 0.9.5, but it is deprecated and will be removed in
    GBBopen 0.9.6).

  * The PENDING-ACTIVATION-OF link-slot in the KSA unit-class has been renamed
    PENDING-ACTIVATION.

  * The accessor ACTIVATION-CYCLE-OF replaces KSA.ACTIVATION-CYCLE (a
    KSA.ACTIVATION-CYCLE accessor remains available in 0.9.5, but it is
    deprecated and will be removed in GBBopen 0.9.6).

  * The accessor EXECUTION-CYCLE-OF replaces KSA.EXECUTION-CYCLE (a
    KSA.EXECUTION-CYCLE accessor remains available in 0.9.5, but it is
    deprecated and will be removed in GBBopen 0.9.6).

  * The accessor KS-OF replaces KSA.KS (a KSA.KS accessor remains available in
    0.9.5, but it is deprecated and will be removed in GBBopen 0.9.6).

  * The accessor OBVIATION-CYCLE-OF replaces KSA.OBVIATION-CYCLE (a
    KSA.OBVIATION-CYCLE accessor remains available in 0.9.5, but it is
    deprecated and will be removed in GBBopen 0.9.6).

  * The accessor RATING-OF replaces KSA.RATING (a KSA.RATING accessor remains
    available in 0.9.5, but it is deprecated and will be removed in GBBopen
    0.9.6).

  * The accessor TRIGGER-EVENTS-OF replaces KSA.TRIGGER-EVENTS (a
    KSA.TRIGGER-EVENTS accessor remains available in 0.9.5, but it is
    deprecated and will be removed in GBBopen 0.9.6).

  * The slot accessors of all standard GBBopen system and control-shell events
    have been changed to the new <slot-name>-OF (:suffix) format.  No
    backward-compatibility accessors for event slots are provided in GBBopen
    0.9.5, so any references to the old event-slot accessors will need to be
    changed.
