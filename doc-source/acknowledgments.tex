Many people have contributed comments, suggestions, design ideas, questions
(and answers), bug reports, and code to GBBopen, and we appreciate their time
and effort.  Acknowledgment of some of their contributions here does not
necessarily imply that any individual or the organizations with which they are
affiliated endorse GBBopen or this documentation.  Disclaimers aside, GBBopen
users thank each of you!

Douglas Crosher ported GBBopen to \xsitelink{Scieneer
  CL}{http://www.scieneer.com/scl/}.  \xsitelink{Gary
  King}{http://www.metabang.com/} worked on the initial \xsitelink{Digitool
  MCL}{http://www.digitool.com/} and
\xsitelink{OpenMCL}{http://openmcl.clozure.com/} porting efforts.
Christian Lynbech performed the initial CMUCL port.  \xsitelink{Sam
  Steingold}{http://www.podval.org/~sds/} initiated the
\xsitelink{CLISP}{http://clisp.cons.org/} port.

\xsitelink{Zack
  Rubinstein}{http://www.ri.cmu.edu/people/rubinstein_zack.html} and
Susan Lander continue to demand additional capabilities and contribute
suggestions.  Other questioners and bug reporters include:
\xsitelink{Clayton Morrison}{http://www.isi.edu/~clayton/}, Matthew

Other efforts using GBBopen that have indirectly led to GBBopen improvements
and enhancements include: research supported by the ``Fusion Based Knowledge
for the Future Force'' ATO program and the ``Advanced REsearch Solutions -
Fused Intelligence with Speed and Trust'' program at the U.S. Army RDECOM
CERDEC Intelligence and Information Warfare Directorate, Fort Monmouth, NJ,
under contract W15P7T-05-C-P621; research on ``Command \& Control and Data
Fusion Architectures'' supported by DND Canada under contract W7701-4-2118;
and research supported by the AFRL ``Advanced Computing Architecture''
program, under contract FA8750-05-1-0039.

\paragraph{Legacy  Contributors}

GBBopen builds upon concepts and ideas that were explored and refined in the
UMass Generic Blackboard system and the commercial GBB product.  The following
people made significant contributions to those systems:
