          Known Common Lisp Implementation Issues when using GBBopen

CMUCL 20b (all platforms)
 - CMUCL's native WITH-TIMEOUT (used in :portable-threads) doesn't nest
   correctly; however we still expose the native version (in the hope that it
   will be fixed someday) rather than rolling our own.  Nested WITH-TIMEOUT
   users beware!!!!

ECL 11.1.1 (all platforms)
 - :gbbopen-tools-test encounters an incorrect ratio comparison result:
   Incorrect GBBOPEN-TOOLS:PARSE-TIME GBBOPEN-TOOLS-USER::ZONE result for 
   "10:30 IST": -11/2 expected; -11/2 returned

SBCL 1.0.44-50 (all platforms)
 - :agenda-shell-test fails to trigger all KSAs when started by load/autorun; 
   works correctly when invoked after file loading
