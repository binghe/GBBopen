<h2><a name="id1">Step 1: Obtain and install Common Lisp</a></h2><p>
GBBopen requires a supported Common Lisp implementation.  If one has already
been installed on your system, then this step is finished.  (That was easy!)
If not, then you will need to choose, obtain, and install a Common Lisp
implementation before moving on to the next step.
</p>
<p>The list of Common Lisp implementations, with version numbers, on which
GBBopen is supported is maintained on the &#8220;<a target="_top" href="http://GBBopen.org/ports.html">Current
ports</a>&#8221; page of the GBBopen Project
<a target="_top" href="http://GBBopen.org/">web site</a>.  The list includes commercial
products and open-source implementations made available under varying license
arrangements.  The vendors of commercial Common Lisp products offer no-cost
&#8220;Trial&#8221; or &#8220;Personal&#8221; editions that can support the tutorial exercises and
allow you to become familiar with their products before making a purchase
decision.
</p>
<p>Choosing a particular implementation is a subjective decision.  Some Common
Lisp implementations run on only a single platform.  Some implementations do
not provide multiprocessing (thread) support on some or all of the platforms
that they run on.  Some implementations come with their own integrated
development environment (IDE), interactive graphics facilities, and supported
libraries and extensions.  When it comes to selecting an implementation, there
is no &#8220;best&#8221; answer (but there is also no wrong answer, if the
implementation meets your current needs).  All these Common Lisp
implementations strive to conform to the ANSI (American National Standards
Institute) standard for the Common Lisp language.  By writing GBBopen
applications to remain consistent with the ANSI standard (including portable
extensions to the standard that are provided by GBBopen), we can easily run
our code on any Common Lisp implementation that provides similar capabilities
(such as threads, for example).
</p>
<p>If you would rather not explore the space of Common Lisp implementations for
your platform, Peter Seibel (the author of <a target="_top" href="http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/"><i>Practical Common
Lisp</i></a>) provides
<a target="_top" href="http://www.gigamonkeys.com/lispbox/">Lispbox</a>.  Lispbox
(&#8220;Lisp in a Box&#8221;) offers an easy to install, no-cost, Common Lisp
environment for Linux/86, Macintosh OS X, and Windows.  Lispbox packages
together a Common Lisp implementation,
<a target="_top" href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs.html">Emacs</a>, and the
<a target="_top" href="http://common-lisp.net/project/slime/">SLIME</a> Common Lisp
development environment for Emacs.  For the less adventurous, installing
Lispbox can be an appealing way to get started.
</p>
<p>However you choose to obtain Common Lisp, you must have an installed and
operating implementation for your system before proceeding to the next step.
</p>
<h2><a name="id2">Step 2: Obtain and install GBBopen</a></h2><p>
Unless someone has already installed GBBopen on your machine, you will need to
obtain and install it.  GBBopen is available in source form from
<a target="_top" href="http://GBBopen.org/"><nobr><code>http://GBBopen.org/</code></nobr></a>. In this
step I discuss three different approaches for downloading GBBopen, and you can
follow whichever approach is most familiar for you.  (In the absence of any
preference, I recommend the Subversion client approach.)
</p>
<h3><a name="id3">Downloading the snapshot archive</a></h3><p>
A snapshot archive of the GBBopen source-code repository can be downloaded
from
<a target="_top" href="http://gbbopen.org/downloads/GBBopen.tar.gz"><nobr><code>http://gbbopen.org/downloads/GBBopen.tar.gz</code></nobr></a>.
Extract the archive into a directory of your choosing, and follow the
&#8220;Compiling All GBBopen Modules&#8221; instructions that are contained in the
<code>README</code> file of the installation.
</p>
<h3><a name="id4">Downloading with Subversion</a></h3><p>
Alternatively, if you are familiar with
<a target="_top" href="http://subversion.tigris.org">Subversion</a> and have a Subversion
client installed on your computer, you can checkout the latest files directly
from the GBBopen repository.  For example, the shell command:
<pre class="pretop">
<font color="#667f66">  [~]&#36; <font color="#000000">svn checkout http://GBBopen.org/svn/GBBopen/trunk/ gbbopen</font></font>
</pre>
will create a GBBopen repository tree rooted at the directory named
<code>gbbopen</code> in your current working directory.  As above, follow the
&#8220;Compiling All GBBopen Modules&#8221; instructions that are contained in the
<code>README</code> file of the installation.
</p>
<p><a name="id5">GBBopen</a> development is ongoing, and you should update your GBBopen
installation regularly in order to obtain the latest capabilities and
enhancements.  Subversion provides an easy way to keep current, and you are
strongly encouraged to install a Subversion client and use it perform frequent
updates.  Simply issue the command:
<pre class="pretop">
<font color="#667f66">  [~/gbbopen]&#36; <font color="#000000">svn update</font></font>
</pre>
from the root directory of your GBBopen repository tree.  
The <a target="_top" href="http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/">TortoiseSVN</a> Subversion
client is highly recommended for Windows users.  TortoiseSVN is
smoothly integrated with the Windows Shell (Explorer) and is as easy
to use as <a target="_top" href="http://www.tortoisecvs.org/">TortoiseCVS</a> (also
highly recommended if aren't already using it as your CVS client on
Windows).
</p>
<p>Subversion <code>.svn</code> administrative directories are included in the GBBopen
snapshot archive, so a Subversion <code>update</code> command can be used to freshen
a GBBopen installation that was originally installed using the snapshot
archive download-and-extraction approach described previously.
</p>
<h3><a name="id6">Downloading with clbuild</a></h3><p>
If you use <a target="_top" href="http://common-lisp.net/project/clbuild/">clbuild</a>, you
can use it to download the latest GBBopen sources by issuing the following
command:
<pre class="pretop">
<font color="#667f66">  [~]&#36; <font color="#000000">clbuild install gbbopen</font></font>
</pre>
</p>
<p>At any later time, you can issue the command:
<pre class="pretop">
<font color="#667f66">  [~]&#36; <font color="#000000">clbuild update gbbopen</font></font>
</pre>
to obtain the latest sources from the GBBopen repository.
</p>
<p>If your clbuild doesn't know about GBBopen, add the following line to the
clbuild wnpp-projects file:
<pre class="pretop">
  gbbopen get_svn http://gbbopen.org/svn/GBBopen/trunk/ #blackboard-system framework, tools, &#38; utilities
</pre>
</p>
<p>As was the case with the other two download methods, follow the &#8220;Compiling
All GBBopen Modules&#8221; instructions that are contained in the GBBopen
<code>README</code> file to complete the installation.
</p>
<h3><a name="id7">Downloading with Quicklisp</a></h3><p>
If you use <a target="_top" href="http://www.quicklisp.org/beta/">Quicklisp</a>, you can use
it to download and install GBBopen by evaluating the following form once
Quicklisp is set up:
<pre class="pretop">
<font color="#667f66">  &gt; <font color="#000000">(ql:quickload "gbbopen")</font>
  ;; GBBopen is installed in <var>&lt;install-dir&gt;</var>
  ;; Your "home" directory is <var>&lt;homedir&gt;</var>
  ;; Predefining :SWANK-BACKEND package for SLIME...
  ;; No shared module command definitions were found in <var>&lt;install-dir&gt;</var>/gbbopen-modules/.
  ;; No personal module command definitions were found in <var>&lt;homedir&gt;</var>/gbbopen-modules/.
  ;; GBBopen is installed in <var>&lt;install-dir&gt;</var>
  ;; Your "home" directory is <var>&lt;homedir&gt;</var>

  ;; No shared module command definitions were found in <var>&lt;install-dir&gt;</var>/gbbopen-modules/.
  ;; No personal module command definitions were found in <var>&lt;homedir&gt;</var>/gbbopen-modules/.
  ;; Defining an ASDF defsystem for each Module Manager module...
  To load "gbbopen":
    Load 1 ASDF system:
      gbbopen
  ; Loading "gbbopen"

  ("gbbopen")
  &gt;</font>
</pre>
</p>
<p>As was the case with the other download methods, follow the &#8220;Compiling
All GBBopen Modules&#8221; instructions that are contained in the GBBopen
<code>README</code> file to complete the installation.
</p>
<h2><a name="id8">Step 3: Subscribe to the GBBopen mailing lists</a></h2><p>
I strongly recommend that you subscribe to the GBBopen Announcements
(<nobr><code>gbbopen-announce</code></nobr>) and the GBBopen Users
(<nobr><code>gbbopen-list</code></nobr>) mailing lists.  To subscribe, go to the &#8220;Mailing
Lists&#8221; page on the <a target="_top" href="http://GBBopen.org/">GBBopen web site</a> and
click on the appropriate <code>subscribe</code> links.  The traffic is low, and the
messages and advice will save you time and frustration and get you writing
quality GBBopen applications easier and sooner.  (You might even want to
browse the archived messages that are accessible from the &#8220;Mailing Lists&#8221;
page.)
</p>
<p>If you need help or advice, the GBBopen Users list is the place to ask (should
this tutorial and archived messages from the GBBopen Users list come up
short).
</p>
<h2><a name="id9">Step 4: Interact with the REPL</a></h2><p>
This tutorial assumes that you have a basic understanding of Common Lisp and,
in particular, how to interact with the Common Lisp implementation that you
are using.  Thus, you should be able to start up your Common Lisp system and
enter forms into the &#8220;Lisp Listener&#8221; (also called the read-eval-print loop
or simply the REPL) that it provides.  
</p>
<p>When you start your Common Lisp system, it may first display some informational
messages and then you should see a prompt for input that looks something like:
<pre class="pretop">
<font color="#667f66">  &gt;</font>
</pre>
The specific format of the prompt differs depending on your Common Lisp
implementation.  The prompt character may vary, such as <code>*</code>, <code>:</code>, or
<code>?</code>.  The prompt might include a entry number that is incremented each
time an expression is entered, such as:
<pre>
<font color="#667f66">  [1]&gt;</font>
</pre>
or it might also include the name of the current package (symbol namespace)
being used by the REPL:
<pre>
<font color="#667f66">  cl-user(1)&gt;</font>
</pre>
</p>
<p>For the remainder of this tutorial, we will include the package name in our
example prompts to make it clear what package should be current:
<pre class="pretop"><font color="#667f66">  cl-user&gt;</font>
</pre>
The REPL prompt indicates that it is awaiting a Common Lisp expression to
evaluate and then display the evaluation results. For example, enter the
expression:
<pre>
<font color="#667f66">  cl-user&gt; <font color="#000000">(+ 1 2)</font>
  3
  cl-user&gt;</font>
</pre>
Note that what you need to enter is shown in black and other items, such as
the REPL prompt and displayed result, <code>3</code>, are shown in gray.  We will
follow this convention throughout the tutorial to help make it clear what you
must provide in the context of other information.
</p>
<p>You may find it easier and faster to cut and paste text from this tutorial (if
you are working with it on-line) rather than typing what is requested.  On the
other hand, some feel that they learn faster (and improve retention) through
the action of typing.  Either text-entry approach, however, is preferable to
simply reading through the exercises.  This tutorial is about <i>learning by doing!</i>
</p>
<p><a name="id10">While</a> we are on the subject of what is displayed, enter the following
expression:
<pre class="pretop">
<font color="#667f66">  cl-user&gt; <font color="#000000">'symbol</font>
  symbol
  cl-user&gt;</font>
</pre>
The displayed result that you see might be in lower case, as shown, or upper
case, or even capitalized.  In this tutorial, results are shown with Common
Lisp symbols displayed in lower case, which I prefer as being slightly easier
to read.  If you wish, you can duplicate this behavior in your REPL by
entering the following form:
<pre>
<font color="#667f66">  cl-user&gt; <font color="#000000">(setf *print-case* ':downcase)</font>
  :downcase
  cl-user&gt;</font>
</pre>
</p>
<p><a name="id11">Your</a> Common Lisp implementation may also differ slightly on how it displays
multiple returned values.  For example:
<pre class="pretop">
<font color="#667f66">  cl-user&gt; <font color="#000000">(values 1 2 3)</font>
  1
  2
  3
  cl-user&gt;</font>
</pre>
</p>
<p>In this tutorial, we show multiple returned values as displayed on separate
lines.  Your Common Lisp implementation may show them differently, such as
with semicolon value-separator characters:
<pre class="pretop">
<font color="#667f66">  cl-user&gt; <font color="#000000">(values 1 2 3)</font>
  1 ;
  2 ;
  3
  cl-user&gt;</font>
</pre>
</p>
<h2><a name="id12">Step 5: Recover from an error</a></h2><p>
Even you are a very careful typist, sooner or later you will enter a Common
Lisp expression that signals an error.  Therefore, it is important that you
know how to get back on track when the inevitable occurs.  Let's intentionally
generate an error.  Enter:
<pre class="pretop">
<font color="#667f66">  cl-user&gt; <font color="#000000">(/ 1 0)</font>
  Error: Attempt to divide 1 by zero.
  cl-user&gt;&gt;</font>
</pre>
</p>
<p>The behavior of your Common Lisp environment should look similar, and you
should now be in your implementation's debugger or &#8220;break loop.&#8221;  The
debugger prompt may differ from the standard REPL prompt to help remind you
that you are in the break loop.  Alternatively, your implementation may open
another window or buffer in response to the error.  Your implementation may
allow you to continue entering Common Lisp expressions at the break prompt
that are evaluated and the results displayed just as if you were in the normal
REPL (opening the possibility of causing another error and triggering another
instance of the debugger).  You can use the debugger to inspect the nesting,
or &#8220;backtrace,&#8221; of function calls that led to the error, view and edit local
variable bindings, and so forth, and you can often correct the cause of the
error and resume the broken evaluation directly from the debugger.
</p>
<p>For this tutorial, you only need to know how to abort out of the evaluation
and return back to the REPL if you trigger an error.  The details for aborting
the computation and exiting the debugger are implementation dependent, so you
may need to investigate how to abort out of an error on your Common Lisp
implementation.  For example, it might be as easy as entering an abort
debugger command:
<pre class="pretop">
<font color="#667f66">  cl-user&gt; (/ 1 0)
  Error: Attempt to divide 1 by zero.
  cl-user&gt;&gt; <font color="#000000">:a</font>
  cl-user&gt;</font>
</pre>
Consult your Common Lisp documentation or a knowledgeable friend if
you need assistance with the debugger in your Common Lisp
implementation (<code>:a</code> or <code>q</code> are typical abort commands).
</p>
<h3><a name="id13">Breaking a computation</a></h3><p>
There are other mistakes that don't signal an error.  Suppose I
foolishly evaluate this expression:
<pre class="pretop">
<font color="#667f66">  cl-user&gt; <font color="#000000">(loop (print "This is repetitive...") (sleep 1))</font>

  "This is repetitive." 
  "This is repetitive." 
       ...</font>
</pre>
Once I grow tired of watching this phrase repeat, it would be good to
terminate the evaluation without having to kill the entire Common Lisp
program.
</p>
<p>Again, the specifics depend on your Common Lisp environment, but all that is
needed is to interrupt, or &#8220;break,&#8221; the computation.  Often this is
associated with typing one or more Control-c (<code>^c</code>) characters:
<pre class="pretop">
<font color="#667f66">  cl-user&gt; (loop (print "This is repetitive...") (sleep 1))

  "This is repetitive." 
  "This is repetitive." 
       ...
  "This is repetitive." 
  "This is repetitive." 
  "This is rep<font color="#000000">^C</font>
  Error: Received keyboard interrupt ^C
  cl-user&gt;&gt;</font>
</pre>
Typically a keyboard interrupt invokes the debugger where the computation
can be resumed or aborted:
<pre>
<font color="#667f66">  cl-user&gt; (loop (print "This is repetitive...") (sleep 1))

  "This is repetitive." 
  "This is repetitive." 
       ...
  "This is repetitive." 
  "This is repetitive." 
  "This is rep^C
  Error: Received keyboard interrupt ^C
  cl-user&gt;&gt; <font color="#000000">:a</font>
  cl-user&gt;</font>
</pre>
</p>
<h3><a name="id14">Help! My REPL is broken!</a></h3><p>
Here is one last difficulty.  Suppose I enter:
<pre class="pretop">
<font color="#667f66">  cl-user&gt; <font color="#000000">(list "This" "is "also" "a" "problem!")</font>
  cl-user&gt;
  cl-user&gt;
  cl-user&gt;</font>
</pre>
My REPL seems dead: no result is displayed and I continue to be prompted again
and again for input.  I suppose I should try the entering the expression
again:
<pre>
<font color="#667f66">  cl-user&gt; (list "This" "is "also" "a" "problem!")
  cl-user&gt;
  cl-user&gt;
  cl-user&gt;
  cl-user&gt; <font color="#000000">(list "This" "is" "also" "a" "problem!")</font>
  cl-user&gt;
  cl-user&gt;</font>
</pre>
Nope, my REPL is still broken.
</p>
<p>Of course the cause of the problem is that I forgot the closing double-quote
character on <code>"is"</code> when I entered the first expression.  The REPL is
still patiently waiting for me to finish that first Common Lisp expression.
(I didn't break it after all!)
</p>
<p>So how do I get out of this?  I could try entering a sequence of double-quote
and close parentheses and hope I that I get lucky:
<pre class="pretop">
<font color="#667f66">  cl-user&gt; (list "This" "is "also" "a" "problem!")
  cl-user&gt;
  cl-user&gt;
  cl-user&gt;
  cl-user&gt; (list "This" "is" "also" "a" "problem!")
  cl-user&gt;
  cl-user&gt;
  cl-user&gt; <font color="#000000">"</font>
  cl-user&gt; <font color="#000000">)</font>
  Error: Attempt to take the value of the unbound variable `also'.
  cl-user&gt;&gt;</font>
</pre>
or I could interrupt the REPL read operation, just as I did with the infinite
loop situation above, and abort back from the debugger to the REPL and try
again:
<pre>
<font color="#667f66">  cl-user&gt; (list "This" "is "also" "a" "problem!")
  cl-user&gt;
  cl-user&gt;
  cl-user&gt;
  cl-user&gt; (list "This" "is" "also" "a" "problem!")
  cl-user&gt;
  cl-user&gt;
  cl-user&gt; <font color="#000000">^C</font>
  Error: Received keyboard interrupt ^C
  cl-user&gt;&gt; <font color="#000000">:a</font>
  cl-user&gt; <font color="#000000">(list "This" "is" "also" "a" "problem!")</font>
  ("This" "is" "also" "a" "problem!")
  cl-user&gt;</font>
</pre>
</p>
<p>You may discover even more creative ways to get into problems, but these
example situations should give you enough experience to get through the rest
of the tutorial.
</p>
<h2><a name="id15">Step 6: Load the <code>:gbbopen-user</code> module</a></h2><p>
GBBopen is packaged with its own module system
that supports compiling and loading GBBopen components.
</p>
<p><a name="id16">To</a> compile and load the <nobr><code>:gbbopen-user</code></nobr> module and all the GBBopen

</p>
<p>GBBopen should compile (if necessary) and load all the files needed for the
next exercise without error.  The output on your Common Lisp implementation
may vary somewhat from that shown above.  For example, the file extension for
compiled files, shown as <code>.fasl</code> throughout this tutorial, is dependent on
your Common Lisp implementation and platform.

<p>Notice that loading the <nobr><code><var>&lt;install-dir&gt;</var>/initiate.lisp</code></nobr> file
loaded only GBBopen's REPL command processing extensions, global REPL command
definitions, and module-directory processing into Common Lisp&ndash;the Module
Manager is not loaded until it is needed (such as when we performed the
<nobr><code>:gbbopen-user</code></nobr> REPL command).  The ASDF <code>:gbbopen</code>
&#8220;system&#8221; start up, on the other hand, must also load the Module Manager and
module definitions, as they are required in order to define an ASDF system for
each Module Manager module.

<h3><a name="id18">Packages</a></h3><p>
Note that when the <code>:gbbopen-user</code> module was loaded, the Module Manager
changed the current package to the <nobr><code>:gbbopen-user</code></nobr> package.  In the Common Lisp implementation above, this is shown by the new package name in the REPL prompt.  The current package can also be seen by evaluating:
<pre class="pretop">
<font color="#667f66">  cl-user&gt; <font color="#000000">*package*</font>
  #&lt;package GBBOPEN-USER&gt;
  gbbopen-user&gt;</font>
</pre>
</p>
<p>In Common Lisp, a <i>package</i> is a namespace that maps names to
symbols.  One package is always designated as the &#8220;current&#8221; package, and it
is this package that is used by default for creating and finding symbols by
their names.  Initially, the current package is set to the
<nobr><code>:common-lisp-user</code></nobr> package.  The <nobr><code>:gbbopen-user</code></nobr>
module creates a new package, named <nobr><code>:gbbopen-user</code></nobr>, that includes
GBBopen Tools and GBBopen Core symbols in addition to the standard Common Lisp
symbols.  If the current package is not set to the <nobr><code>:gbbopen-user</code></nobr>
package in the exercises to follow, references to GBBopen functions and
variables will not map to the proper symbols.
</p>
</p>
<h3><a name="id19">If it didn't work<i>...</i></a></h3><p>
If you are running GBBopen in a Common Lisp environment that doesn't support
REPL commands and the <nobr><code>:gbbopen-user</code></nobr> REPL command didn't work,
all is not lost.  Loading <nobr><code><var>&lt;install-dir&gt;</var>/initiate.lisp</code></nobr>
also defines functions in the <nobr><code>:common-lisp-user</code></nobr> package with the
same name as the REPL command:
<pre class="pretop">
<font color="#667f66">  cl-user&gt; <font color="#000000">(load "<var>&lt;install-dir&gt;</var>/initiate.lisp")</font>
  ;; Loading <var>&lt;install-dir&gt;</var>/initiate.lisp
  ;; GBBopen is installed in <var>&lt;install-dir&gt;</var>
  ;; Your "home" directory is <var>&lt;homedir&gt;</var>
  ;;     Loading <var>&lt;install-dir&gt;</var>/extended-repl.lisp
  ;;     Loading <var>&lt;install-dir&gt;</var>/commands.lisp
  ;;     Loading <var>&lt;install-dir&gt;</var>/gbbopen-modules-directory.lisp
  ;; No shared module command definitions were found in <var>&lt;install-dir&gt;</var>/gbbopen-modules/.
  ;; No personal module command definitions were found in <var>&lt;homedir&gt;</var>/gbbopen-modules/.
  #P"<var>&lt;install-dir&gt;</var>/initiate.lisp"
  cl-user&gt; <font color="#000000">(gbbopen-user)</font>
  ;; Loading <var>&lt;install-dir&gt;</var>/startup.lisp
     ...
  ;; Loading <var>&lt;install-dir&gt;</var>/<var>&lt;platform-dir&gt;</var>/gbbopen/gbbopen-user.fasl
  gbbopen-user&gt;</font>
</pre>
</p>
<h3><a name="id20">File protection problems?</a></h3><p>
If one or more GBBopen files needs to be compiled, you must have write
permission for those files and directories on your file system.  If you do not
have write permission and someone else is maintaining your GBBopen
installation, you must remind them that they should perform the &#8220;Compiling
All GBBopen Modules&#8221; operations (described in the GBBopen installation
<code>README</code> file) every time they update GBBopen to ensure that all the
latest GBBopen files have been compiled.
</p>
<h3><a name="sec:REPL-command-syntax">REPL command syntax</a></h3>
<p>GBBopen's REPL commands are defined to mimic the syntax of existing REPL
commands in your Common Lisp environment.  REPL commands, including those that
have arguments, are normally specified using a non-list (&#8220;spread&#8221;)
representation. For example:
<pre class="pretop">
  cl-user&gt; :gbbopen-user :create-dirs
  ;; Loading <var>&lt;install-dir&gt;</var>/startup.lisp
     ...
  ;; Loading <var>&lt;install-dir&gt;</var>/<var>&lt;platform-dir&gt;</var>/gbbopen/gbbopen-user.fasl
  gbbopen-user&gt;
</pre>
Some Common Lisp implementations (<a target="_top" href="http://trac.clozure.com/ccl">Clozure
CL</a>,
<a target="_top" href="http://www.lispworks.com">LispWorks</a>, and
<a target="_top" href="http://sbcl.sourceforge.net">SBCL</a>) and the
<a target="_top" href="http://common-lisp.net/project/slime/">SLIME</a> REPL interface, also
support REPL commands in non-spread (list) form in addition to the
spread notation.  For example:
<pre>
  cl-user&gt; (:gbbopen-user :create-dirs)
  ;; Loading <var>&lt;install-dir&gt;</var>/startup.lisp
     ...
  ;; Loading <var>&lt;install-dir&gt;</var>/<var>&lt;platform-dir&gt;</var>/gbbopen/gbbopen-user.fasl
  gbbopen-user&gt;
</pre>
</p>
<p>As noted above, equivalent functions in the <nobr><code>:common-lisp-user</code></nobr>
package are always defined for each REPL command, and these functions can be
used in place of the keyword REPL command processing:
<pre class="pretop">
<font color="#667f66">  cl-user&gt; <font color="#000000">(cl-user:gbbopen-user :create-dirs)</font>
  ;; Loading <var>&lt;install-dir&gt;</var>/startup.lisp
     ...
  ;; Loading <var>&lt;install-dir&gt;</var>/<var>&lt;platform-dir&gt;</var>/gbbopen/gbbopen-user.fasl
  gbbopen-user&gt;</font>
</pre>
</p>
<p>We will show the <a href="#sec:REPL-command-syntax">spread command syntax</a>
throughout the rest of the Tutorial.  (GBBopen's REPL commands are summarized
in the <a target="_top" href="http://GBBopen.org/downloads/command-refcard.pdf">GBBopen REPL Commands Quick Reference
Card</a>, available on the
GBBopen web site.)

<h3><a name="id22">Beyond <code><var>&lt;install-dir&gt;</var>/initiate.lisp</code></a></h3><p>
Although loading GBBopen's <nobr><code><var>&lt;install-dir&gt;</var>/initiate.lisp</code></nobr>
file is a very easy way to get started with GBBopen, setting up your computing
environment for serious GBBopen development requires only a few moments that
will be recouped almost immediately.  The steps needed to set everything up
will be detailed soon in the <a href="tutorial-development-environment.html">Enhancing Your Development Environment
exercise</a>.
