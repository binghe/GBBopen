Important changes since GBBopen 1.0:

  None yet.


Important changes in GBBopen 1.0:
  
  * Support added for set-composite dimension values and space-instance
    storage of them; support for incomposite (scalar) pattern retrieval of
    set-composite unit instances

  * Added processing of <install-dir>/shared-gbbopen-modules (processed 
    immediately before user's personal <homedir>/gbbopen-modules)

  * Added system-name tagging of extended-REPL commands, directory
    definitions, and module definitions
     - New WITH-SYSTEM-NAME macro added to support this

  * Changes to extended-REPL commands:
     - DEFINE-TLL-COMMAND renamed to DEFINE-REPL-COMMAND (DEFINE-TLL-COMMAND
       is deprecated and will be removed in GBBopen 1.1)
     - New built-in extended-REPL commands:
        :systems   Shows all system-names used in commands, directory 
                   definitions, and module definitions
        :commands [<system-name>] 
                   Shows all extended-REPL commands; if system-name is
                   specified, then only those commands are displayed
        :undefine-system <system-name>
                   Removes all commands, directory definitions, and 
                   module definitions associated with <system-name>

  * Changes to Mini Module system:
     - Added Mini Module support for "Source" and "SOURCE" directory-name
       conventions (in addition to the recommended "source")
     - Added application-version modifier support to DEFINE-ROOT-DIRECTORY
     - New GET-ROOT-DIRECTORY Mini Module function
     - New WITH-MODULE-REDEFINITIONS macro
     - Incremented Mini Module version to 1.3


Important changes in GBBopen 0.9.9:

  * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: INSTANCE-DIMENSION-VALUE now returns five values:
      1. the dimension value of the unit instance in the specified dimension
      2. the dimension-value type of the specified dimension
      3. the comparison type of the specified dimension
      4. the composite type of the dimension value, if it is a
         composite; NIL if it is an incomposite value
      5. the name of the ordering dimension if the dimension value is
         a series composite; NIL otherwise
    The third value is new in GBBopen 0.9.9.

  * Renamed "specified comparison test" element (enumerated dimension) 
    pattern operators:
       EQ     -> IS-EQ
       EQL    -> IS-EQL
       EQUAL  -> IS-EQUAL
       EQUALP -> IS-EQUALP 
    The old operator names are deprecated, but will remain available until the
    next release

  * New comparison-type specification support for DEFINE-UNIT-CLASS
    :DIMENSIONAL-VALUES class option

  * The :TEST option for a hashed-storage specification to
    MAKE-SPACE-INSTANCE is deprecated, as the comparison test is now
    determined from the dimension comparison-type specifications of
    the unit classes associated with the hashed storage

  * <install-dir>/gbbopen-init.lisp renamed to more intuitive
    <install-dir>/initiate.lisp

  * Reloading of changed commands.lisp and modules.lisp files in
    <homedir>/gbbopen-modules/ directory  

  * New :nopropagate option to COMPILE-MODULE and LOAD-MODULE; improved
    remembering of REPL :cm and :lm command parameters 

  * New :MINI-MODULE-USER package

  * New :CLASS-NAME-TRANSLATIONS argument added to LOAD-BLACKBOARD-REPOSITORY
    and WITH-READING-SAVED/SENT-OBJECTS-BLOCK

  * New NEXT-CLASS-INSTANCE-NUMBER function

  * New FIND-ALL-INSTANCES-BY-NAME function

  * New INSTANCE-DIMENSION-VALUES function

  * New handler-forms (evaluated in the dynamic context of the error) and new
    ERROR-CONDITION lexical function added to WITH-ERROR-HANDLING

  * New *WARN-ABOUT-NONPORTABLE-SAVING/SENDING* global variable

  * CHANGE-CLASS support to/from non-unit instances


Important changes in GBBopen 0.9.8:

  * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: New DELETE-BLACKBOARD-REPOSITORY function
    replaces typical uses of RESET-GBBOPEN:
    - RESET-GBBOPEN now unconditionally deletes/resets all instances,
      event functions, and event printing

  * New :RETAIN class option in DEFINE-UNIT-CLASS (and DEFINE-SPACE-CLASS,
    DEFINE-KS-CLASS, and DEFINE-KSA-CLASS), controls default
    DELETE-BLACKBOARD-REPOSITORY behavior on instances of that class:
      nil  = don't retain 
      true = retain (a value of :PROPAGATE indicates propagation of
                     :PROPAGATE retention value (as default) to subclasses)
    - The :RETAIN class option is overridden if DELETE-BLACKBOARD-REPOSITORY
      is invoked with a true :ALL-CLASSES keyword value

  * POTENTIALLY INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: Queue objects (headers, elements) are now
    unit instances, all queue-management entities have been moved from the
    :GBBOPEN-TOOLS package to the :GBBOPEN package; new Agenda Shell unit
    classes KSA-QUEUE and ORDERED-KSA-QUEUE
    - Any subclasses of ORDERED-QUEUE, QUEUE, and QUEUE-ELEMENT that were
      defined previously to be unit instances should no longer include
      STANDARD-UNIT-INSTANCE in their direct superclasses

  * New :instance-name argument for START-CONTROL-SHELL and 
    RESUME-CONTROL-SHELL


Important changes in GBBopen 0.9.7:

  * Renamed functions:
       ALLOWED-UNIT-CLASSES      -> ALLOWED-UNIT-CLASSES-OF
       SPACE-INSTANCE-CHILDREN   -> CHILDREN-OF
       SPACE-INSTANCE-DIMENSIONS -> DIMENSIONS-OF
       SPACE-INSTANCE-PARENT     -> PARENT-OF
       UNIT-CLASS-DIMENSIONS     -> DIMENSIONS-OF

  * Save & load blackboard repository support; PRINT-OBJECT-FOR-SAVING/SENDING
    protocol

  * Version 1.2 of the Mini-Module System
    - Support for module-relative directory specifications; implicit module
      rooting

  * Added LIST-LENGTH>1, LIST-LENGTH>, SHRINK-VECTOR, and TRIMMED-SUBSTRING to
    GBBopen-tools
 
  * Version 2.2 of the Portable Threads Interface
    - Periodic functions

  * Version 2.1 of the Portable Threads Interface
    - Scheduled functions, new THREAD-ALIVE-P and ENCODE-TIME-OF-DAY functions

  * Version 2.0 of the Portable Threads Interface
    - Recursive and nonrecursive locks, with stronger enforcement of usage
      violations (to reduce the potential for different behavior on different
      CL implementations).
    - Use of condition variables for thread waiting/notification
    - Improved hibernation behavior
    - New WITH-TIMEOUT function

    The names of many Portable Threads functions were changed (for
    consistency with new capabilities and to make the portable-threads
    interface names more "thread-centric" rather than "process-centric"):
       ALL-PROCESSES             -> ALL-THREADS
       AWAKEN-PROCESS            -> AWAKEN-THREAD
       CURRENT-PROCESS           -> CURRENT-THREAD
       HIBERNATE-PROCESS         -> HIBERNATE-THREAD
       KILL-PROCESS              -> KILL-THREAD
       MAKE-PROCESS-LOCK         -> MAKE-RECURSIVE-LOCK
       PROCESS-NAME              -> THREAD-NAME
       PROCESSP                  -> THREADP
       PROCESS-WAIT              -> THREAD-WAIT
       PROCESS-WAIT-WITH-TIMEOUT -> THREAD-WAIT-WITH-TIMEOUT
       PROCESS-WHOSTATE          -> THREAD-WHOSTATE
       PROCESS-YIELD             -> THREAD-YIELD
       RUN-IN-PROCESS            -> RUN-IN-THREAD
       SPAWN-PROCESS             -> SPAWN-THREAD
       SYMBOL-VALUE-IN-PROCESS   -> SYMBOL-VALUE-IN-THREAD
       WITH-PROCESS-LOCK         -> WITH-LOCK-HELD
       <new>                        CONDITION-VARIABLE (object)
       <new>                        CONDITION-VARIABLE-BROADCAST
       <new>                        CONDITION-VARIABLE-SIGNAL
       <new>                        CONDITION-VARIABLE-WAIT
       <new>                        CONDITION-VARIABLE-WAIT-WITH-TIMEOUT
       <new>                        MAKE-CONDITION-VARIABLE
       <new>                        MAKE-LOCK
       <new>                        THREAD-HOLDS-LOCK-P
       CLOSE-GATE                   <removed>
       GATE-OPEN-P                  <removed>
       MAKE-GATE                    <removed>
       OPEN-GATE                    <removed>
       PROCESS-WAIT                 <removed>
       PROCESS-WAIT-WITH-TIMEOUT    <removed>


Important changes in GBBopen 0.9.6:

  * Rewrite of the uniform-buckets storage machinery and how it interacts 
    with WITH-CHANGING-DIMENSION-VALUES. 


Important changes in GBBopen 0.9.5:

  * The default accessors generated by DEFINE-CLASS, DEFINE-EVENT-CLASS, 
    DEFINE-UNIT-CLASS, and DEFINE-SPACE-CLASS are now <slot-name>-OF (:suffix
    format) rather than <class-name>.<slot-name> (:prefix format).

  * A new macro WITH-GENERATE-ACCESSORS-FORMAT is provided to facilitate
    historical (:prefix format) or other non-standard accessor-name generation
    in a block of DEFINE-CLASS, DEFINE-EVENT-CLASS, DEFINE-UNIT-CLASS, and
    DEFINE-SPACE-CLASS definitions.

  * The accessor INSTANCE-NAME-OF replaced INSTANCE-NAME 

  * The function SPACE-INSTANCES-OF replaced INSTANCE-SPACE-INSTANCES

  * The generic function SOLE-TRIGGER-INSTANCE-OF replaced
    SOLE-TRIGGER-INSTANCE

  * The generic function SOLE-TRIGGER-EVENT-OF replaced SOLE-TRIGGER-EVENT

  * The accessor KS-ENABLED-P replaced KS.ENABLED

  * The PENDING-ACTIVATION-OF link-slot in the KSA unit-class replaced
    PENDING-ACTIVATION

  * The accessor ACTIVATION-CYCLE-OF replaced KSA.ACTIVATION-CYCLE

  * The accessor EXECUTION-CYCLE-OF replaced KSA.EXECUTION-CYCLE

  * The accessor KS-OF replaced KSA.KS

  * The accessor OBVIATION-CYCLE-OF replaced KSA.OBVIATION-CYCLE

  * The accessor RATING-OF replaced KSA.RATING

  * The accessor TRIGGER-EVENTS-OF replaced KSA.TRIGGER-EVENTS

  * The slot accessors of all standard GBBopen system and control-shell events
    were changed to <slot-name>-OF (:suffix) format.
