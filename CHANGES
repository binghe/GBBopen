    in GBBopen 0.9.5 (including INSTANCE-NAME and INSTANCE-SPACE-INSTANCES).


Important changes in GBBopen 0.9.5:

  * The default accessors generated by DEFINE-CLASS, DEFINE-EVENT-CLASS, 
    DEFINE-UNIT-CLASS, and DEFINE-SPACE-CLASS is now <slot-name>-OF (:suffix
    format) rather than <class-name>.<slot-name> (:prefix format).

  * A new macro WITH-GENERATE-ACCESSORS-FORMAT is provided to facilitate
    historical (:prefix format) or other non-standard accessor-name generation
    in a block of DEFINE-CLASS, DEFINE-EVENT-CLASS, DEFINE-UNIT-CLASS, and
    DEFINE-SPACE-CLASS definitions.

  * The PENDING-ACTIVATION-OF link-slot in the KSA unit-class has been renamed
    PENDING-ACTIVATION.

  * The accessor ACTIVATION-CYCLE-OF replaces KSA.ACTIVATION-CYCLE (a

    have been changed to the new <slot-name>-OF (:suffix) format.  No
    backward-compatibility accessors for event slots are provided in GBBopen
    0.9.5, so any references to the old event-slot accessors will need to be
    changed.
